        I started learning web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building basic websites and understanding front-end fundamentals. Over time, I expanded my skills with Bootstrap, React, and jQuery, while also using Git and VS Code to manage my workflow. Later, I explored back-end development with Node.js and began building full-stack applications using Next.js.
